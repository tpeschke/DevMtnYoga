	Methods to get Repo
1) Fork (opt)			copy a reop and makes it my own
2) git clone (opt)		[url] - copies to wherever you are
// make changes	
3) git add .			tracks all documents
4) git commit -m "message"	gets ready to push
5) git push origin master	updates to github

You can't directly clone a new git repo into an existing repo with this method

git submodule add <url> <first git repo>/<new git repo>
				^i.e., to put in Projects: Projects/JS-Array
